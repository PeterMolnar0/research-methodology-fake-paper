## Short Descriptions

### 1. Automatic Web Testing Using Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning

The research basicly describe the _WebExplor_ tool what is an automatic end-to-end web testing framework. It explores the web application (pages, operations, navigations, etc.). It adopts curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to generate high-quality test cases.

The document contains the basics of the tool, how it is working, and how the developers can use it. Moreover the writers are showing some live test result and proving the efficiency of the tool.

### 2. Software and Performance Testing Tools

The research is speaking about the importance of the testing, web application testing and the automatic testing.

The main line is the automation. Why we need to automatize different procedures and testing of course.

It's providing examples and description about different tools. Testing tools (SELENIUM, API, TestComplete, Katalon), Research tools (LoadNinja, Apache J Meter), Performance testing tools.

### 3. Why many challenges with GUI test automation (will) remain

The research is marking the the importance of the test automation especially for web GUI testing. The main concept is the the challanges with the GUI test automation. The document identify and describe some challanges based on several other researches.

Some of the found challanges:

- The application changes invoke the fix of the tests
- Unit, integration, end-to-end tests
- Widget, component tests
- Testing dynamic applications
- Maintain test data sets and test tools

The document isn't giving solutions.

### 4. An automated model-based approach to repair test suites of evolving web applications

They show a model-based approach what is able to repair the created (Capture-Replay) test cases, after breaking changes. It is DOM-based and independent of the Capture-Replay tool.

They compare this new method against the state-of-the-art (WATER).

The model-based approach is capturing the differences between two state. The tool detecting the changes what are affect the test cases. It's generating a modification list and applying it. It can handle different testing tools.

The research provides examples, experiments and measurements.

### 5. A Web Testing Platform Based on Hybrid Automated Testing Framework

The research shows an hyprid solution to managing the large-scaled test cases for the huge applications and reduce the cost of the maintenance.

The solution tries to combine the advantages of the keyword-driven and the data-driven testing frameworks. They seperate the object library and function library and the test data are randomly generated from them. It supports free and flexible management.

The research contains only the theory of the idea and the attributes of the based tools.

### 6. A comparative study of automation testing tools for web applications

The research compares two major automatic testing tools: The Katalon Studio and Selenium. They are analyzed in a real web application with real test cases.

It describe a lot of testing types like:

- Static testing
- Dyanmic testin
- Compatibility testing
- Regression testing
- Performance testing
- Usability and accessibility testing
- Security testin
- etc.

The research introudce some testing frameworks and tools with some advantages and disadvantages. After that run simulations with Katalon Studio and Selenium and comparing the results.
