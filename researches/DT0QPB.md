## Short Descriptions

### 1. Automatic Web Testing Using Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning

The research basicly describe the _WebExplor_ tool what is an automatic end-to-end web testing framework. It explores the web application (pages, operations, navigations, etc.). It adopts curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to generate high-quality test cases.

The document contains the basics of the tool, how it is working, and how the developers can use it. Moreover the writers are showing some live test result and proving the efficiency of the tool.

### 2. Software and Performance Testing Tools

The research is speaking about the importance of the testing, web application testing and the automatic testing.

The main line is the automation. Why we need to automatize different procedures and testing of course.

It's providing examples and description about different tools. Testing tools (SELENIUM, API, TestComplete, Katalon), Research tools (LoadNinja, Apache J Meter), Performance testing tools.

### 3. Why many challenges with GUI test automation (will) remain

The research is marking the the importance of the test automation especially for web GUI testing. The main concept is the the challanges with the GUI test automation. The document identify and describe some challanges based on several other researches.

Some of the found challanges:

- The application changes invoke the fix of the tests
- Unit, integration, end-to-end tests
- Widget, component tests
- Testing dynamic applications
- Maintain test data sets and test tools

The document isn't giving solutions.
